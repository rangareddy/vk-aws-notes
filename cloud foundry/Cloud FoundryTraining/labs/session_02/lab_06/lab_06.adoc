= Lab 6 - Binding to Cloud Foundry Services

[abstract]
--
The _Spring Music_ application was designed to illustrate the ease with which various types of data services can be bound to and utilized by Spring applications running on Cloud Foundry.
In this lab, we'll be binding the application to both MySql and MongoDB databases.

Cloud Foundry services are managed through two primary types of operations:

Create/Delete:: These operations create or delete instances of a service.
For a database this could mean creating/deleting a schema in an existing multitenant cluster or creating/deleting a dedicated database cluster.
Bind/Unbind:: These operations create or delete unique credential sets for an existing service instance that can then be injected into the environment of an application instance.

== A Bit of Review

Your instance of _Spring Music_ should still be running from the end of link:../lab_05/lab_05.html[Lab 5].
Visit the application in your browser by hitting the route that was generated by the CLI:

image::../../../Common/images/Spring_Music_NS.png[]

The information dialog in the top right-hand corner indicates that we're currently running with an in-memory database, and that we're not bound to any services.
Let's change that.

== The Services Marketplace

There are two ways to discover what services are available on Pivotal Web Services.
The first is available on any instance of Cloud Foundry: the CLI. Just type:

----
$ cf marketplace
----

and you'll get a list of services, their available plans, and descriptions.

The second way is specific to Pivotal Cloud Foundry's Application Manager UI.
If you haven't already, login to it by visiting {CF-CONSOLE-URL}.

Click on the ``Marketplace'' link:
_The Screenshots below are from Pivotal Web Services (public managed Pivotal CF).  If you are using Pivotal Cloud Foundry, you will see something similar._

and you'll see the same service/plan/description listing in the browser:

== Creating and Binding to a Service Instance

Let's begin by creating a MySql instance provided by Pivotal.

. From the CLI, let's _create_ a p-mysql service instance:
+
----
$ cf create-service p-mysql 512mb spring-music-db
Creating service instance spring-music-db in org pcfdev-org / space pcfdev-space as admin...
OK
----

. Next we'll _bind_ the newly created instance to our `spring-music` application:
+
----
$ cf bs spring-music spring-music-db
Binding service spring-music-db to app spring-music in org pcfdev-org / space pcfdev-space as admin...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf restage spring-music' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
----

. Notice the admonition to `Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect`.
Let's take a look at the environment variables for our application to see what's been done. We can do this by typing:
+
----
$ cf env spring-music
----
+
The subset of the output we're interested in is located near the very top, titled `System-Provided`:

<1> `VCAP_SERVICES` is a special Cloud Foundry environment variable that contains a JSON document containing all of the information for any services bound to an application.
<2> Notice here the unique URI for this instance of MySql that `spring-music` has been bound to.
====

. Now let's _restage_ the application, which cycles our application back through the staging/buildpack process before redeploying the application.footnote:[In this case, we could accomplish the same goal by only _restarting_ the application via `cf restart spring-music`.
A _restage_ is generally recommended because Cloud Foundry buildpacks also have access to injected environment variables and can install or configure things differently based on their values.]
+
----
$ cf restage spring-music
----
+
Once the application is running again, revisit or refresh the browser tab where you have the _Spring Music_ application loaded:
+
image::../../../Common/images/Spring_Music_PGSQL.png[]
+
As you can see from the information dialog, the application is now utilizing a MySql database via the `spring-music-db` service.

. *(OPTIONAL STEPS)* If you have a MySql GUI tool handy and you are using a lab environment that has the necessary network access (ask your instructor), you can inspect the music database created. Otherwise, your instructor will demo via a Pivotal VPN connection.

. In your DB tool, create a new server connection and populate the properties with values from the URI in your `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable (remember `cf env spring-muisc`!):

== Optional: Swapping from MySql to MongoDB (Try on PWS)

. Now let's bind our _Spring Music_ application to MongoDB instead of MySql. First let's create footnote:[Notice in this listing that we're typing `cf cs` rather than `cf create-service`.
Most CF CLI commands have a shorthand version to save typing time.
You can view these shorthand commands via `cf help` or `cf h` (See! More shorthand!).] a MongoDB instance from the Pivotal Cloud Foundry marketplace:
+
----
$ cf cs p-mongodb development spring-music-mongo
Creating service spring-music-mongo in org ACME / space instructor as mstine@pivotal.io...
OK
----

. Next we'll unbind our application from our MySql instance (_Spring Music_ does not support being bound to multiple datasources at the same time):
+
----
$ cf us spring-music spring-music-db
----
+
If you visit your application now, you'll see that it still works.
If you recall, environment variable changes (such as binding/unbinding of services) don't actually take effect until a _restage_ or _restart_.

. Now let's bind the application to our MongoDB instance:
+
----
$ cf bs spring-music spring-music-mongo
Binding service spring-music-mongo to app spring-music in org oreilly-class / space instructor as mstine@pivotal.io...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
----

. And then do a restage:
+
----
$ cf restage spring-music
----

+
Once the application is running again, revisit or refresh the browser tab where you have the _Spring Music_ application loaded:
+
image::../../../Common/images/Spring_Music_Mongo.png[]
+
As you can see from the information dialog, the application is now utilizing a MongoDB database via the `spring-music-mongo` service.

. *(OPTIONAL)* Similar to the steps to view the relational data in another DB tool, a MongoDB client tool can be used to inspect the MongoDB instance.  Your instructor can demo this if you do not have access to the tool and / or the appropriate network access to the MongoDB instance.

== Clean Up

Because of the limited PWS quota we have for this course, let's clean up our application and services to make room for future labs.

. Delete the `spring-music` application:
+
----
$ cf d spring-music

Really delete the app spring-music?> y
Deleting app spring-music in org oreilly-class / space instructor as mstine@pivotal.io...
OK
----

. Delete the `spring-music-mongo` service:
+
----
$ cf ds spring-music-mongo

Really delete the service spring-music-mongo?> y
Deleting service spring-music-mongo in org oreilly-class / space instructor as mstine@pivotal.io...
OK
----

. Delete the `spring-music-db` service:
+
----
$ cf ds spring-music-db

Really delete the service spring-music-db?> y
Deleting service spring-music-db in org oreilly-class / space instructor as mstine@pivotal.io...
OK
----
